  ```env
  ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000,http://localhost:8081
  ```

### 1.3 Database Migration
- [ ] Ensure PostgreSQL is running

  cd apps/server
  bun run db:generate
  bun run db:push
  ```

### 1.4 Clerk Webhook Configuration
- [ ] Go to Clerk Dashboard ‚Üí Webhooks
- [ ] Click "Add Endpoint"
- [ ] Set webhook URL: `https://your-api.com/api/v1/auth/webhooks/clerk`
  - For local testing, use ngrok: `https://abc123.ngrok.io/api/v1/auth/webhooks/clerk`
- [ ] Subscribe to events:
  - [ ] `user.created`
  - [ ] `user.updated`
  - [ ] `user.deleted`
  - [ ] `session.created`
  - [ ] `session.ended`
- [ ] Copy webhook secret
- [ ] Add to `.env`:
  ```env

  ```

## Phase 2: Testing

### 2.1 Server Testing
- [ ] Start the server:
  ```bash
  bun run dev
  ```
- [ ] Verify server starts without errors
- [ ] Test health check endpoint:
  ```bash
  curl http://localhost:3000/health
  ```
- [ ] Check server logs for any errors

- [ ] Test protected endpoint:
  ```bash
  curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/v1/users/profile \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer <test_token>"
  ```
- [ ] Verify user data returned
- [ ] Test without token (should return 401)

### 2.4 Middleware Testing
- [ ] Test rate limiting:
  ```bash
  # Send 150 requests rapidly
  for i in {1..150}; do
    curl http://localhost:3000/api/v1/users/profile \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" &
  done
  wait
  ```
- [ ] Should see 429 rate limit errors after threshold

  export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
    return (
      <ClerkProvider>
        {children}
      </ClerkProvider>
    );
  }
  ```

  ```env
  NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
  ```

- [ ] Create sign-in page
- [ ] Create sign-up page
- [ ] Test authentication flow

### 3.3 API Integration

- [ ] Configure API client to include Clerk token:
  ```typescript
  import { useAuth } from '@clerk/nextjs';
  
  const { getToken } = useAuth();
  const token = await getToken();
  
  const response = await fetch('http://localhost:3000/api/v1/users/profile', {
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`
    }
  });
  ```
